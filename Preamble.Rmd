# Preamble

**This bookdown document is intended as a repository of technical information related to the use of electronic field data entry tools**, including reviews of different software options, hardware, and factors regarding interfacing with external sensors and downstream databases.  

The initial information was gleaned from interviews and presentations organized during a DUWG Electronic Data Entry Device ("e-device") focus group (6/2022-6/2023), but these reports are far from exhaustive and there are many software/hardware options for field data entry that have not yet been reviewed.  Meanwhile communication and cloud processing technology is advancing rapidly.  

**This initiative generally asks that all IEP survey teams that have e-device experience, or those that are adding digital data-entry tools to their program, please share these experiences and help to develop this resource for other IEP surveys seeking to update data entry protocols.**

## **Table 1: Summary of Date Entry Software Reviewed** 

An Executive Summary reporting on the activities in this DUWG e-device subgroup was shared with IEP Coordinators Team in Sept of 2023. This report may be downloaded using the below link and Table 1 from this report is included here. 
```{r e_surv, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
