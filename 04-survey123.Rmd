# ESRI Survey123 

## Survey123 Overview  {#s12top} 

From ESRI documentation: ArcGIS Survey123 is a complete, form-centric solution for creating, sharing, and analyzing surveys. Use it to create forms with skip logic, defaults, and support for multiple languages. Collect data using web or mobile devices, even when disconnected from the internet. Upload data securely, and analyze results on the web or in an ArcGIS app.

From G2 Business Software Review: Survey123 is included with ArcGIS, and provides powerful features to help you leverage the power of location to boost your productivity while capturing data and analyzing the results of your surveys. https://www.g2.com/products/arcgis-survey123/reviews


## Survey123: Key Features 

### Survey123 Form Developing Interface

Surveys123 Survey Forms are created and stored through the ESRI web interface (see \@ref(fig:ESRIweb)); access requires a current ESRI license. Survey123 forms can be downloaded to tablets, iPhones or iPads, and data collection can be made while the device is offline. Survey results are uploaded to cloud storage next time the device is on-line.

```


```{r ESRIweb, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Screen capture of the ESRI web interface for Survey123 and the option to Create New Survey.", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survey123/ESRIweb.png", error = FALSE)
```

There are two main options for designing a Survey123 survey form (\@ref(fig:ESRIweb2)): the Web Designer or Survey123 Connect tool. The Web Designer is a web-based menu-driven GUI that does not require learning any specific coding to set up a basic survey form.  Survey questions and response types can be specified using a drag and drop tool.

knitr::include_graphics("images/survey123/ESRIweb2.png", error = FALSE)
```



Survey123 Connect is an option for more advanced survey form design, such as a nested structure or calculated responses from user inputs.  The Survey123 Connect approach requires defining the more advanced form properties within an ‘XLSForm spreadsheet’ using the XLSForm coding language (XLSForm spreadsheets: \@ref(fig:xlsform) and \@ref(fig:xlsform2)).  ESRI documentation for both Web designer and Connect can be found at: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/survey123/browser/create-surveys/createsurveys.htm
XLSForm formatting language is described at: https://xlsform.org/en/.
