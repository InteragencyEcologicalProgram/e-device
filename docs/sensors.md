Admittedly, it also needs updating with some of the newer commands.  Until that can be accomplished, hopefully soon, I will work directly with anyone wanting to integrate their application with the boards.

### Alternative Software: Dcs5 Controller

On the aside, here's a recent application, made by Jerome Guay, which interfaces to the DCS5 XT boards:

And here's a Discord channel where you can ask questions about the DCS5 Firmware-

# Navigation Data

## NMEA2000 CanBUS to USB converter

The gateway allows you to see data from a NMEA 2000 marine digital network on a PC, laptop or tablet PC with Microsoft Windows, Mac OS or Linux. With it, you get marine network data including vessel course, speed, position, wind speed and direction, water depth.

The device is called a NMEA2000 CanBUS to USB converter. There are several commercial versions offered. The USB100 from Maretron is the most common: https://www.maretron.com/products/usb100.php ($295)

This is the type of connector we need in order to tap into the ships navigation system:

Depending on the set up in the vessel, we may also need to order a small NMEA 2000 power cable: ($27.00)

Here is a blurb from an email from the Furuno technical expert regarding this method of data extraction from the navigation equipment:
