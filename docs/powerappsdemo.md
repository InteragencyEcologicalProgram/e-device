# SF Bay Study: PowerApps Trial App   {#powdem}


The SF Bay Study ES staff have explored several electronic data entry software to support the complex Bay Study survey collections.  The software app that has shown the most promise is the Microsoft Form software 'Power Apps'.  T

SF Bay Study Power app (BSPapp) main menu options include new sample and edit sample options; data export by csv or direct transfer to the SQL database; options to edit records that are stored on the device, call "collections" or records that have been transferred to the SQL database located on a remote system.
