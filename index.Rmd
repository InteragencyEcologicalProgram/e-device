# Preamble

**This bookdown document is intended as a repository of technical information related to the use of electronic field data entry tools**, including reviews of different software options, hardware, and factors regarding interfacing with external sensors and downstream databases.  

The initial information was gleaned from interviews and presentations organized during a DUWG Electronic Data Entry Device ("e-device") focus group (6/2022-6/2023), but these reports are far from exhaustive and there are many software/hardware options for field data entry that have not yet been reviewed.  Meanwhile communication and cloud processing technology is advancing rapidly.  


**General Request: To help develop this resource for other IEP surveys seeking to update their data entry protocols, the initiative requests that all IEP surveys that have e-device experience, or those adding digital data-entry tools to their programs, [contribute and share](#contrb) their experience**
